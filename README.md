# BAI DAO

**Welcome to our project DAO**

BAI is a project focused on its community feedback, and now that we have implemented the basic tools of our platform, we plan to involve all interested active members in the decision-making process. This will include decisions on which new blockchain to support, which new Large Language Models (LLMs) to implement, and even considerations on how to utilize the project's BAI token.

Before submitting a request for a vote, you must first discuss it here using the "Discussions" tab. Create a new topic, choose the appropriate label, and then share the link in BAI's Telegram channel: https://telegram.me/baitoken. Once the idea has been discussed and you believe it has enough community support, you can initiate the actual voting process. The voting application are already available at:

Polygon DAO:
https://polygon.blockai.dev/dao

BNB DAO:
https://bnb.blockai.dev/dao

Waves DAO:
https://waves.blockai.dev/dao

We encourage everyone with an idea to start discussing it now.

**How to Obtain BAI's DAO Voting Power?**

The voting power in BAI's DAO employs a unique approach, based on platform usage: the more you use the platform features, the more you build up your voting power. This approach ensures that the platform evolves based on its active users, not merely on who holds the most tokens.
