# BAI's DAO

**Welcome to BAI DAO**

Before submitting a request for a vote, you must first discuss it here using the "Issues" tab. Create a new topic, choose the appropriate label, and then share the link in BAI's Telegram channel: https://telegram.me/baitoken. Once the idea has been discussed and you believe it has enough community support, you can initiate the actual voting process. The voting application will be released soon, but we encourage everyone with an idea to start discussing it now.

**How to Obtain BAI's DAO Voting Power?**

The voting power in BAI's DAO employs a unique approach, based on platform usage: the more you use the platform features, the more you build up your voting power. This approach ensures that the platform evolves based on its active users, not merely on who holds the most tokens.
